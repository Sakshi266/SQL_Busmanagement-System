# 🚌 Bus Management System (SQL)

## 📌 Project Overview
The Bus Management System is a database-driven project developed using SQL to manage and organize bus transportation operations efficiently. This system handles information related to buses, routes, schedules, passengers, and ticket bookings using a structured relational database.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design a structured relational database for bus management  
- Manage bus details, routes, and schedules  
- Store passenger and booking information  
- Practice SQL queries, constraints, and relationships  
- Demonstrate real-world database management concepts  

---

## 📁 Project Structure
- **busmanagement.sql** – SQL script containing:
  - Table creation statements  
  - Primary and foreign key relationships  
  - Insert queries  
  - Sample select queries  

---

## 🗄️ Database Components
The system includes tables such as:
- Buses  
- Routes  
- Schedules  
- Passengers  
- Bookings / Tickets  

These tables are connected using proper **primary keys and foreign keys** to maintain data integrity.
